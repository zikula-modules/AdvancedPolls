Permissions
-----------
The Zikula permissions system can be used to restrict access to both the
administrative and user features of this module. Examples of the usage of
permissions in this module are as follow

1 Core Module

In addition to the voting regulations in each poll permissions can be used to
restrict voting to specific groups of users. To restrict the poll 'A Sample
Poll' with a Poll ID of 5 from a group called 'Non Voting Users' set these
permissions

Group - Non Voting Users
Component - advanced polls::item
Instance - A Sample Poll::5
Permissions Level - None

2 Poll Block

To disallow unregistered users from seeing the a poll block titled 'A Sample
Poll' set these permissions

Group - Unregistered
Component - advanced_polls:pollblock:
Instance - A Sample Poll::
Permissions Level - None

3 PollList Block

To disallow unregistered users from seeing the a polllist block titled 'Voting
Booth' set these permissions

Group - Unregistered
Component - advanced_polls:polllistblock:
Instance - Voting Booth::
Permissions Level - None

All permissions examples can be equally applied to user based permissions.
